# Measles overlap

## Overview

*P* gene has capacity to encode three proteins:

> [P/V/C] gene proteins


1. P-protein (phosphoprotein) -- is coded by the majority of the P/V/C gene
2. C-protein -- encoded from an alternative reading frame (+1 relative to P):

> Beginning of C-protein: alternative start shifting frame to +1

3. V-protein -- N-terminal 231 aa are identical between V and P. The remaining 68 aa and completely different because of an RNA editing evcent that inserts a G at position 2,499 and shift the remainder of readingh frame creating the V protein. In this case the phase is +2:

> Editing site shifting V-protein reading frame to +2

## Alignemnts

These datasets we generated by:

1. Pulling SRA data for BioProjects PRJNA1017431, PRJNA1145141, and PRJNA869081 (see table above). 
2. Running Wolfgang's workflow for variant calling
3. Downloading consensus sequences for each sample.
